UPDATE

I am no longer working on this - instead I am working on a cooler solution which combines a http server and a compiler 
in one application.  You write C programs and skip the compliation phase, the internal C compiler automatically 
compiles the script to memory and executes it.  I am using libevent for the HTTP stuff and tcc for the compiler.

FF - Fast Framework.

This is an experiment.  There are many web frameworks out there for every
language you can think of.  There are not many however for C which isn't
surprising.  I wondered what a C framework might look like, one who's
goal was making web development with C easy.
